//NetBeans

//NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, but also with other languages,

//The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible JVM. 
//The NetBeans Platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular software components called modules. 
//Applications based on the NetBeans Platform (including the NetBeans IDE itself) can be extended by third party developers.
//The NetBeans Team actively support the product and seek feature suggestions from the wider community. Every release is preceded by a time
