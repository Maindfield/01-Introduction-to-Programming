PHP 

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. As of January 2013, PHP was installed on more than 240 million websites (39% of those sampled) and 2.1 million web servers. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the reference implementation of PHP (powered by the Zend Engine) is now produced by The PHP Group. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, which is a recursive backronym.

Difference between C# and PHP
Function names don’t have a “function” in the declaration as in PHP
In C# classes are implemented (derived) with a : instead of the “implements” declaration
Class constructors in C# have the same name as the class…much like PHP 4 used to be, if I remember correctly
To run the code in the parent constructor, C# uses :base() right after the child class constructor declaration (public ChildClass :base() {})
All variables, data sets and objects need to have a type declared – after all C# is a strongly typed language

JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript is classified as a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and first-class functions. This mix of features makes it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

Difference between C# and JavaScript
There are many differences, and are used for different purposes.
Javascript is a non-typed scripting language, which means it typically runs uncompiled in browsers.
C# is a strongly-typed language, which is typically compiled into a .dll.
They DO have similar syntax, however.

Java

Java is a functional computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2015, one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers

Difference between C# and Java
Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly, and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, both use garbage-collection, and both are "curly brace languages" like C and C++.

Python

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Difference between C# and Python
Python is scripting language who work's on multi platforms, and its easier to learn, while C# is more powerfull. C# is programming language and is harder to master.
